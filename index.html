            <p><strong>Did You Know</strong> To widen monthly budgets: Loans such as payday loans and money advances are by some people to help them tide over their bills before payday. Due to the financial crisis, the cash crunch has become real for many
              people in the Africa. Payday loan usage has soared as the key way to help people sort out a few payments while they are waiting for their pay to come through. Relying on loans every month is not a good idea and payday loans and money advances

              money will be returned, and borrowers don’t know when to repay the loans.</p>
